After transitioning to a full-time role, I was promoted to Lead QA Engineer. In this role, I manage and mentor other student QAs, helping them integrate into the team while ensuring high-quality delivery. I take ownership of end-to-end quality workflowsâ€”from defining test strategies and structured test cases to building automated test flows using Cypress. I work closely with developers and support teams to surface critical issues early, reduce bugs in production, and streamline release readiness."

On the frontend, I used React Native to deliver a smooth, mobile-first experience with real-time delivery tracking and intuitive ordering flows. I also handled deployment through Azure, ensuring stability and scalability. This project strengthened my ability to design, build, and maintain cloud-based applications from end to end while collaborating closely with the team to meet real user needs."
